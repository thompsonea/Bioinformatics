This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

This document goes through the R exercises (1-4) we did in class for Chapter 8 part 2 in which we practice adding and eliminating rows and columns from the data set: Test_V\_output.csv.

## Exercise 1: Rows and Columns

The total score column was assigned as a vector tot_score. I chose to calculate the total score for row 3, resulting in 340 as the answer. I also looked for what molecules were interacting and found them to be a protein and gem which underwent phosphorylation.

```{r}
tot_score<-Test_V_output$Total.Score
tot_score[3]

```

## Exercise 2: Mean and Standard Deviation

I found the mean and standard deviation of the total scores in the set using the following code. The mean resulted in 63.79919 and the standard deviation was 55.29295.

```{r}
mean(tot_score)
sd(tot_score)

```

## Exercise 3: Vectorization

This section is calculating the total score based off of the combination of the kind scores, evidence scores, match scores, and epistemic values. new_tot was named as a new vector.

```{r}
new_tot = (Test_V_output$Kind.Score+(Test_V_output$Evidence.Score*Test_V_output$Match.Score))
```

## Exercise 4: Subsets

For this section, the locations, cell type, and organism columns were deleted and only the top 100 scored interactions were kept.

```{r}
Test_V_output<-Test_V_output[,!names(Test_V_output)%in% c("Location","Organism","Cell.Type")]
Test_V_output[1:100,]
```
